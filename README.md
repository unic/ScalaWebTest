## [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unic/ScalaWebTest.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/unic/ScalaWebTest) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ScalaWebTest/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/ScalaWebTest/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/ScalaWebTest/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

ScalaWebTest is a library for writing ScalaTest/Selenium based integration tests for websites. It helps you with your basic setup and provides a new and very efficient approach to testing.

In manufacturing, it is common to use gauges (also called checking gauges or testing gauges) to verify whether a workpiece meets predefined criteria and tolerances. ScalaWebTest transfers this concept to the world of web integration testing. You can define a gauge in HTML, and use it to verify your web application. This greatly improves the readability, simplicity of your integration tests.

## Getting Started with development

### Prerequisites

* Java >= 8
* SBT 1.x
* [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

Get familiar with the sbt build tool because this is used to manage the project.

See [Getting Started Guide](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Getting-Started.html)

### Compile, test, package

```bash
$ sbt compile test package
```

### Run whole integration test

Before running the integration tests, you will need to configure `WEBDRIVER_CHROME_DRIVER` environment variable. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
$ export WEBDRIVER_CHROME_DRIVER="$(which chromedriver)"
```

Then run the tests using the command below:

```bash
$ sbt inttest
```

This will start a Jetty server, executes the integration tests and stops the server again.

### Start Jetty server and run single tests

If you would like to run the Jetty server and in parallel work on integration tests, and some code changes,
you can do the following:

```bash
# Enter the sbt console first, enter 'sbt' in root folder
$ sbt

# Start Jetty server
sbt> jetty:start

# Or if you would like that sbt automatically restarts Jetty after code changes then do:
sbt> ~jetty:start

# Open separate command window and enter the sbt console agains
# Run a single integration tests
sbt> it:testOnly org.scalawebtest.integration.gauge.ContainsSpec
```

## How to Release

### Prerequisites

1. Create the file `~/.sbt/1.0/plugins/gpg.sbt` and add the following line `addSbtPlugin("com.jsuereth" % "sbt-pgp" % "1.1.1")`

1. Copy the private key (Sonatype PGP Private and Public Key from our company password store), to `~/.sbt/gpg/secring.asc`

1. Create the file  `~/.sbt/1.0/sonatype.sbt` and add the following content, then replace username and password with your personal oss.sonatype credentials

```scalas
credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
                           "oss.sonatype.org",
                           "<your username>",
                           "<your password>")
```

### Release

The release process of ScalaWebTest is currently done manually. The process is as follows:

1. Switch the version in `build.sbt` to that which is to be released (e.g. from `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` to `1.0.0`)
1. In your command line type in the following:
    1. navigate to the root folder of the ScalaWebTest git repository
    1. `sbt` - enters the sbt interactive mode
    1. `+ clean` - deletes all generated files (target)
    1. `+ test` - compiles and tests the main sources
    1. `+ doc` - generate scaladoc
    1. `mimaReportBinaryIssues` - execute the Migration Manager to verify binary compatibility
    1. `inttest` - compile and run the integration tests
    1. `+ publishSigned` - publishes all packages, sources and poms 
    1. Enter the Sonatype PGP Key Password as stored in our company password store
    1. Go to <https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories> verify and close the staging repository
    1. `exit` - exits the sbt interactive mode
1. Commit your changes with the commit message "Release x.x.x" (e.g. `Release 1.0.0`)
1. Tag this commit with the release version `git tag -a x.x.x -m "x.x.x"`
1. Switch the version in `build.sbt` to the snapshot version (e.g. from `1.0.0` to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`) and update the documentation if needed
1. Finally, commit those changes with the commit message "Bump version to x.x.x-SNAPSHOT" (e.g. `Bump version to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`)
1. Push your changes, and the tag
