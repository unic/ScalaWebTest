        <header><h3>Fixed a bug in the misfit relevance calculation</h3></header>
        <p>We found an error in the calculation of the misfit relevance, see <a href="https://github.com/unic/ScalaWebTest/issues/38">issue 38</a> for details.
            Although this didn't effect whether a <i>HtmlPage</i> or <i>HtmlElement</i> fitted the provided gauge, it sometimes led to the wrong reason being shown,
            in case it didn't fit the gauge.
            This might be very misleading, therefore an upgrade to version 1.1.0 is highly recommended.
